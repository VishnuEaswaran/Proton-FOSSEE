# Proton-FOSSEE

Proton is an arduino based development board with a battery of on-board sensors and actuators bundled with provisions for multiple communication technologies. Designed to be a one-stop solution for prototyping, it could serve as a playground for hardware novices as well as seasoned developers. 


P.S. : Proton is a project developed by FOSSE of IIT bombay. The project is in active decelopment and thus watch this space for latest updates.
